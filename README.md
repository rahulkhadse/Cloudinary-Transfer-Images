# Cloudinary-Transfer-Images

This is C# Code to transfer images from one account to another account while retaining public-id. There are other solutions available on support forums but I found it easier and simpler to do things this way. 

This is the way it works. You can have same public id for two images as long as they are in different accounts. This console apps fetches images from source account and uploads it to destination with same public id. You can also manipulate public-id if need be.
